My Project, is a appliction that is supposed to take reminders and hold then till a certain date, but, it only takes input and reads it back to the user.
It uses a record list to retain the data while the application is running. It also has a menu that will either close the program, returns to the start, or tells them to try again based on the input.
first Feature:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
Second Feature:
Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
Third Feature
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project?
There shouldnt be any issues due to simplicity.
